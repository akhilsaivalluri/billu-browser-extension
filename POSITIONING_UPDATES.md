# Speech Bubble & Ear Spacing Updates

## 💬 Speech Bubble Positioning

### Changes Made:
- **Moved speech bubble higher**: Changed `top: -80px` to `top: -120px`
- **Updated mobile responsive**: Changed mobile `top: -65px` to `top: -95px`
- **Result**: Speech bubble now appears above Billu without covering him

### Visual Impact:
- ✅ Billu is now fully visible when speech bubble appears
- ✅ Better visual hierarchy with message clearly above the character
- ✅ Maintains proper bubble tail positioning pointing to Billu
- ✅ Responsive design updated for mobile devices

## 👂 Ear Spacing Improvements

### Changes Made:
- **Main extension**: Changed ear positions from `left: 8px` / `right: 8px` to `left: 5px` / `right: 5px`
- **Popup version**: Changed from `left: 2px` / `right: 2px` to `left: 0px` / `right: 0px`
- **Result**: Increased distance between ears for better proportions

### Visual Impact:
- ✅ More natural ear spacing that looks proportional to the head
- ✅ Better balance and symmetry
- ✅ Ears appear more naturally positioned on the head
- ✅ Consistent spacing between main extension and popup versions
