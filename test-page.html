    <h1>Test Page for Billu Extension - Dog Ears Update</h1>
    <p>This is a test page to verify that the Billu extension works correctly with the new dog ears design.</p>
    
    <div style="height: 2000px; padding: 20px;">
        <h2>Content Section</h2>
        <p>This is some sample content. The extension should show up after a few seconds with Billu's new dog ears!</p>
        
        <p>The dog ears are now floppy and joined with the face, giving Billu a more dog-like appearance while maintaining the cute aesthetic.</p>
        
        <h3>New Features to Test:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Load this page in your browser with the extension installed</li>
            <li>Wait for Billu to appear (should take about 3 seconds)</li>
            <li>Notice the new dog ears - they should be floppy and have more spacing</li>
            <li>Check that the speech bubble is positioned above Billu (not covering him)</li>
            <li>Hover over Billu to see the ear animations</li>
            <li>The ears should gently flop when you hover over Billu</li>
            <li>The speech bubble should show a loading state first</li>
            <li>Then it should display an AI-generated message</li>
        </ol>
        
        <input type="text" placeholder="Test input field" style="width: 300px; padding: 10px; margin: 20px 0;">
        
        <p><strong>Updated Design:</strong> The speech bubble and ears have been improved:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Speech bubble positioned higher so it doesn't cover Billu</li>
            <li>More spacing between dog ears for better proportions</li>
            <li>Oval-shaped droopy ears instead of triangular</li>
            <li>Positioned relative to the face and joined with it</li>
            <li>Subtle rotation for a natural droopy look</li>
            <li>Pink inner ear detail</li>
            <li>Gentle flopping animation on hover</li>
        </ul>
