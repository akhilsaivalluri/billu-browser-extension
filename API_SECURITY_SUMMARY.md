### ✅ What Was Changed

1. **Removed Hardcoded API Key**
   - Completely removed your Azure OpenAI API key from `content.js`
   - No sensitive information remains in source code
   - Safe for public GitHub repository

2. **Added User Configuration System**
   - Settings panel in extension popup
   - Secure local storage of user's own API credentials
   - Built-in connection testing
   - Input validation and error handling

3. **Implemented Fallback System**
